# ErnOneStick

OpenMW mod that allows you to play the game on devices that only have one analogue stick (or D-pad).

## Stick Controls
Your stick has three modes outside of menus:
- Travel Mode. Forward to move forward, left and right to pan camera. Back to quick-turn backward 180 degrees. Camera Tilt will automatically be managed according to ground normals. Tap the Lock Button to enter Target Selection Mode.
- Target Selection Mode. In this mode, the game is paused. Use left or right to switch between available targets in the current Category. The camera will lock on to the active target as you switch between them. Forward and Backward to change the current Category (living actors, loose items, containers[dead actors + containers], everything else[doors + buttons + levers]). Tap the Lock Button again to enter Lock-Mode on the selected target. Tap Escape to enter Travel Mode. If there is no selected target, then you will enter Travel Mode.
- Locked-On Mode. Your camera stays stuck on the selected target. Stick buttons control strafing. You will enter Travel Mode if you move out of range of your target or if you hit Escape. Tap the Lock Button to enter Target Selection Mode.

## Lock-Pause
You get a new button that does Lock Button when tapped. When held, it does Pause.

## Ready-Magic-Ready-Weapon-Unready-Sneak
You get a new button that cycles between Ready Weapon, Ready Magic, and Unready when tapped. Hold it to toggle Sneak.

## Attack-Activate-Jump
You get a new button that attacks if you have a Weapon or Magic readied, and Activates otherwise. If there is nothing to Activate, then you Jump instead.
